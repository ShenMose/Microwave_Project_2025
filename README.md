# Microwave_Project_2025
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and documentation for the 01205322 Microwave Engineering Final Project: Tapered Transmission Line, completed during the second semester of the 2025 academic year at Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand. The project represents the culmination of the Microwave Engineering course and details the full workflow of designing, fabricating, and testing a tapered transmission line, integrating both theoretical analysis and practical implementation. The repository is respectfully dedicated to Professor David M. Pozar, author of Microwave Engineering, and Professor Denchai Worasawate, the course lecturer, in recognition of their significant contributions to microwave engineering education.
